    "## Auto Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "In time series analysis we often make inferences about the past to produce forecasts about the future. In order for this process to be successful, we must diagnose our time series thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such diagnosis method is autocorrelation. This helps us detect certain features in our series to enable us to choose the most optimal forecasting model for our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocorrelation is just the correlation of the data with itself. So, instead of measuring the correlation between two random variables, we are measuring the correlation between a random variable against itself. Hence, why it is called auto-correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is how strongly two variables are related to each other. If the value is 1, the variables are perfectly positively correlated, -1 they are perfectly negatively correlated and 0 there is no correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For time-series, the autocorrelation is the correlation of that time series at two different points in time (also known as lags). In other words, we are measuring the time series against some lagged version of itself.\n"
